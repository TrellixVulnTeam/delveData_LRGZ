# delveData

Delving into data impacting our lives.

---

This project is my playground to explore ways to combine and use different datasets, to improve my problem solving skills, to learn more about Machine Learning techniques, and, hopefully, to get some insights into interrelationships between aspects of our lives that influence our living together. 

There is some more information to be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/nberliner/delveData/wiki) and the [project](http://nberliner.github.io/delveData/) page. 
Please have a look at the collection of IPython Notebooks in the [notebooks](https://github.com/nberliner/delveData/tree/master/notebooks) folder as well!


All data is available in the ```data``` folder and if you feel like delving into the data yourself follow the instructions below.


### Currently included datasets

Currently the following datasets are included in the project. Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/nberliner/delveData/wiki) for more information.

  + World Bank Indicators

  + UNHCR migration database

  + OECD migration statistics

  + Climate data extracted from NOAA

  + Heuristic measure of "public awareness", i.e. measure of newspaper article counts



### Usage notes

The code was written on linux and will not work on Windows machines (sorry about that).

To get started, the easiest would be to use the [Anaconda Python](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution.
Make sure to download Python 3.*!
